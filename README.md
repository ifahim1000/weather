It is an interaction of javascript, HTML, CSS and API. Frontend was built with HTML and CSS. To update the weather data I used "openweathermap.org" 's API. To read data from API calls, I used JSON format. Javascript comes to play to make it more interactive.
I published it as a GIthub Page. Currently the link is broken due to some file issues.
